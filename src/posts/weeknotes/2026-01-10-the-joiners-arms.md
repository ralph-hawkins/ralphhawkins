I started working in a different team this week. A team that sits across Digital Prevention Services Portfolio (DPSP). The team will be doing some new work – figuring out how we coordinate prevention services in the NHS app.

### Origin story

I’ve spoken to a few people this week about my understanding of how this work has come about (I think there’s more to this than I know).

About a year ago, we created a vision for personalised prevention – to help people understand their health risks and connect them to the right support, in an ongoing cycle. Over time the vision was adopted as the direction for all of Digital Prevention Services Portfolio (DPSP).

In Personalised Prevention Services we told teams to not think too much about working with the NHS app. We wanted to test the core hypothesis before engaging with a team that has an incredibly long backlog and an understandably high threshold of quality.

The NHS app is central to the 10 year plan for the NHS. Many teams across DPSP are already building things for the app. Behaviour change, screening, vaccinations, child health, home testing – each working independently. I was in a few sessions where people were asking how do we move from separate teams each doing their own thing to something that resembles the vision and who owns that problem? It felt necessary for DPSP to be able to answer those questions.

That’s what the new team will be looking at.

Also – I want to emphasise to anyone reading this from DPSP, that doesn’t mean we are in any way a gatekeeper, or blocker to teams working with the app. Keep doing the things you’re doing.

### Scope

I'm excited with the new work.

The scope is not totally clear to me yet. I think it lies somewhere between ‘prevention in the app’ and ‘manage my health’.

‘Prevention in the app’ looks like solving how we shape work across behaviour change support, screening and health checks, vaccinations, child health and home testing so that we have a coherent experience for users.

‘Manage my health’ – which I think probably has been defined somewhere, but not that I’ve seen – would include prevention, but also other areas of a person’s interactions with the NHS for example, users managing long‑term conditions probably should be part of managing your health.

The scope will be in part a product of if and how the app team want to federate responsibility and in part about how we meet users’ needs that we don’t totally understand yet. I had a good conversation with head of design for the app, [Mike Gallagher](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mike-gallagher-50aa6966/), about this. Part of the conversation was also about one of the most fundamental problems for the app – how to connect stuff to other stuff. This is the same problem I’ve been grappling with for the last year. Connecting stuff to stuff addresses a core problem of the NHS that manifests everywhere. How do you reduce the overhead of understanding your health and navigating a system as complex as the NHS?

In my immediate future I have two streams of work.

1. Trying to understand what we can quickly and usefully connect within Digital Prevention Services.
2. What does it mean to present a coherent set of things to users of the NHS app that supports them to maintain or improve their health?

Speaking to teams across DPSP will inform how we do both, so my next month of work will be about understanding what people are working on and where there are opportunities.

There’s a lot to do. I’m excited and a little overwhelmed. Hopefully it will get easier as we start to make things more real.

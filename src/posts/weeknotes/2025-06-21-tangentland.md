This week we had one of those workshops were it’s all going fine until it emerges that different parties are working with different assumptions.

The delivery team (and I) have an assumed model of how we can help user to improve their health risks by:

1. asking the user to submit some information about themselves (an assessment)
2. calculating their risks based on that data
3. connecting them to services based on their level of risk, preferences, and location

The ‘stakeholders’ – or people who are a little more remote and closer to policy – have a model where we get to the same outcome by:

1. using data we already hold on the user to target people who are at risk – there is a data‑model already being used to target people at risk of heart disease
2. connecting them to a digital service – digital services are cheaper the in‑person ones (although actually only cheaper if they are effective)

We had assumed that using data to target people would be available later once we were able to collect and connect more data about users.

We also have evidence that behaviour change support is more desirable works better when its in‑person. We also know that connecting people to local services is going to be our biggest challenge. Lots of people have tried and failed to get accurate, well‑maintained data on services available to users. The team have done a lot of good work on how we can start to make that viable.

If we adopt the stakeholder model it means a big change for the work we’re doing. We go from something that feels more like a traditional digital service experience and go towards a much lighter interaction with users, probably more like a marketing campaign. Its an interesting proposition for someone to get a message telling you that the NHS think you’re at risk and suggest you should take some action.

The target marketing approach could be impactful, but I have concerns about some of the things we lose if we adopt it. The biggest loss will be not asking users for their preference and connecting them to something local. Those steps can come later.  It (almost) goes without saying that whatever works best for users and is cost‑effective is the best approach.

I sort‑of sit between the team and the stakeholders, in that I’m less close to the detail of what users need and less close to the policy. Fun. I think there’s a thing that happens with each layer of abstraction that you exist within. The fragmented mess of a user’s experience looks a bit simpler and more solvable the further you get from it.

Our focus for this phase of work is to put things live and start learning as quickly as possible. My loosely‑held take is that if data model is able to target people well and faster than building an assessment, it's reasonable for version 1. We should ship it, learn fast, then move quickly to connecting people to local services. A provable pipeline gives us a better proposition for local services.

More details to be investigated and scope to be agreed.

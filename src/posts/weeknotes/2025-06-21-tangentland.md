This week we had one of those workshops where everything’s going fine until it turns out different people are working with different assumptions. Good to catch these things early.

The delivery team (and I) think we can help people improve their health by:

1. asking people to tell us about themselves (a health check)
2. working out their risks based on what they tell us
3. connecting them to local services based on their risk level and what they want

The policy people have a different model. They want to get to the same outcome by:

1. using data we already have to find people who are at risk – there’s already a system that finds people at risk of heart disease
2. connecting them to an online service – online services are cheaper than face‑to‑face ones (although actually only cheaper if they are effective)

We thought using existing data would come later. In the first instance we’d need to collect and connect more information about people first.

We have some evidence that people prefer face‑to‑face support for when offered a choice. Outcomes are better too. We also know that connecting people to local services will be our biggest challenge. Lots of people have tried and failed to get accurate, up‑to‑date information on what services are available. The team has done good work on how we can start to make this work.

If we follow the policy approach, it’s a big change for our work. We go from something that feels like a normal online service to something much lighter. It’s more like a marketing campaign. It’s an interesting and maybe challenging idea – someone getting a message saying the NHS thinks they’re at risk and should take action.

Digital behaviour change support has benefits and some advantages over in‑person. There’s less of a commitment necessary to get started, small steps are good. But maybe also less engagement. Digital services fit more easily around people’s lives.

The targeted approach could work well. But I’m worried about what we lose. The biggest loss is not asking people what they want and not connecting them to something local. Without those we risk not connecting them to the services that have the best outcomes. Those steps can come later. Obviously whatever works best for people and is cost‑effective is the right approach.

I sit between the team and the policy people. I’m not as close to what users need and not as close to policy. I think there’s something that happens with each layer you move away from users. The messy reality of someone’s experience looks simpler and more solvable the further you get from it.

Our focus for this phase is to get things live and start learning as quickly as possible. My view, for now, is that if the model can find people well and faster than building a health check, it’s reasonable for version one. We should ship it, learn fast, then move quickly to connecting people to face‑to‑face services. I think we need to pragmatic about who this will and won’t work for. If we can create pipeline gives us a better proposition for when we start to work with local services.

We need to understand a lot more:
- how well do the specific digital support work for our users?
- how well can we target people using the data we have (is it accurate, can we differentiate levels of risk)?
- how soon can a model be built and tested?

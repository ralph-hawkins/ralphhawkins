### Health assessments discovery

The discovery into health assessments finished this week.

We asked the team to explore if we could offer more ways for people to assess their health online.

The team created a framework to examine existing health assessments, like pre-screening for lung cancer or assessing diabetes risk.

The framework measured health assessments on how easily they could be implemented digitally, their impact on users’ health and health inequalities, and benefit to the NHS.

The team recommended several health assessments to take forward into an alpha phase.

It’s an exemplary piece of work. Clear thinking, well explained, with actionable recommendations.

I’ll link to the design history summary when it’s published.

### Life and death business cases

As part of the NHS’s ten‑year plan, Digital Prevention Services is creating several business cases.

Creating a business case for our strategy adds useful rigour and invites wider collaboration.

It also adds a layer of farce. Projecting years ahead for something so unproven requires big leaps of imagination. We’re in very early stages, so maybe it will become more evidence-based as we go.

Looking at our work through an economic lens is necessary but gets dark fast. There are measures of economic value for years of life added, working life extended, and quality of life. I find it hard not to think about what these numbers mean for real people and their families. It’s unsettling.

### Vendors

We often speak to external companies who have built something in our space and want to work with us.

Each is different, but there’s a pattern to these conversations:

1. Their software is sophisticated and feature‑rich, which frustrates me that we’re so far behind. Decades of outsourcing tech means the NHS has lost so much institutional knowledge.

2. If their services are good and affordable, we should work with them. But one of our biggest problems in improving services is vendor lock-in.

I have a strong bias against enterprise software, but if that’s the most practical solution, I’ll support it.

### Time dilution

Our management structure is changing.

We had a large senior leadership team relative to our delivery teams. It’s shrinking to lead product, lead delivery and deputy director. I already feel the benefits of having fewer people to consult about decisions.

It’s not clear how discipline leads like me will fit into the new structure. It comes down to how we split time between teams, cross-program needs and supporting people in our discipline.

I’d like to keep leading our program strategy from a service design perspective.

If needed, I’m happy to focus on helping one team, getting closer to research and direct problem-solving.

What I want to avoid is splitting my time too thinly. Some people might handle this well, but I do my best work with a bit of time to think.

- Mike Gallagher – design lead for NHS app and lovely person, writes literary weeknotes I can’t hope to match. Last week’s post on [the tension between middle management and being a designer who designs](https://mikegallagher.org/weeknote-wc-28-april-2025/) perfectly captures my thoughts on this subject.

- Unrelated to public sector service design – I watched this [video on the ethics of fake guitar videos](https://youtu.be/R1QEV9euGAg?si=HjqDPdZryCp9cb9E) by Adam Neely. It’s more interesting than it sounds, especially when he gets into how each music genre has its own set of culturally acceptable behaviours.

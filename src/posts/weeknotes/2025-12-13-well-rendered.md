Digital prevention services portfolio (DPSP) – the wider team I work for, has summer and winter events. An opportunity for everyone to get together.

I missed the summer event, because I had Covid. At the event, there was a 10 minute competition to design a DPSP sticker, I’m not exactly sure of the brief, but I think something to do with representing the portfolio.

I knew this would come my way the second I heard about it. Initially I was very reluctant, this is not how I would choose to design something. But after seeing what my colleagues had come up with, the idea of turning one of the unhinged designs into something more refined sounded like it could be fun.

The stickers were then voted on by everyone. These two stickers were the joint winners.

{{ image("/images/weeknotes/2025-12-13-well-rendered/002.jpg", "Hand-drawn shield design with DNA helix, heart, syringe, and the words Digital Prevention") }}

Sadly for me these were two of the more sane designs.

After a few sketches, the visual language of heraldry felt like a good fit. Starting with a shield as the base and then throwing as many things as possible at it, felt appropriate.

I then started building it in Illustrator. I save and create a new file anytime I’m going to do something irreversible. These are some of the stages.

This is the final sticker. People seemed happy with it. I’m happy contributing to our culture and happy the sticker is finished.

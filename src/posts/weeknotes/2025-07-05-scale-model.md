A challenge working on digital prevention services is the tension of providing healthcare that works for individuals on a scale that works for the country.

## Remote access to healthcare professionals

The highlight of my week was a talk by East Suffolk and North Essex NHS Foundation Trust.

Working with a tech partner, the Trust has created an online channel for people with obesity to access care. Most importantly this includes speaking to qualified healthcare professionals (doctors, psychologists, and specialist nurses) the same level of care as in‑person services. The Trust has a lead clinician responsible for the online patients and the digital channel offers direct referral into pathways that are affected by obesity (for example, sleep apnoea and musculoskeletal). The service has some other features like diet and exercise guidance.

But the important thing about the design of the service is integration. The users of the service are essentially remote patients, the level of care is identical to patients who attend appointments in‑person. They can move between online and in‑person care seamlessly.

This has clear benefits. It saves patients the time, cost and inconvenience of travelling for an appointment. A benefit for everyone, but for people with BMI of 60 or higher, it makes a huge difference. It also means clinicians can see more people.

The service feels transformational because it lines‑up incentives for patients, the Integrated Care Board (ICB), and the Trust. As part of the service, the ICB gets part of their statutory GLP‑1 solution with reduced burden on GPs, hospitals can offer joined‑up support and some reduction of capacity, and patients get choice and faster access.

For me, working from the centre, with a focus on scale, this level of integration between physical and digital feels distant. Even a one‑time hand‑off from our services to local services is difficult. Truly integrated digital and in‑person care is years away. But I am convinced this is what we need to strive for.

## Asking people population level questions

One of our services is looking at digitising the lung cancer screening eligibility assessment – something that currently happens over the phone for most people.

The triage consists of a few questions that calculate the user’s likelihood of having lung cancer. If they meet the threshold then they’re offered a CT scan.

The risk calculation is based on population level statistics. Things like ethnicity and level of social deprivation are factors used to calculate the risk in the model we’re likely to use (there are other models that simply ask if the user has ever smoked and their age).

The evidence and logic of asking population level questions is clear. But the implementation is another thing. For example, in the offline service, a user's level of deprivation is often estimated using proxy questions, such as asking them what level of education they have. It’s pretty startling to be asked this question in a process asking about your health. If you’re speaking to a human on the phone, this can be handled. With a digital service the motivation for asking this question is harder to explain to users. These population risk questions appear hostile to users. It’s possible they will impact completion, there’s a compromise to consider.

I think the exact model we use to calculate risk is still up for grabs. Ideally we can use one that accurately calculates risk without feeling discriminatory. The team are also exploring if we can use different questions to get to the same calculation and ways to explain why the question is being asked, which offers some mitigation.

Long term we hope to use data about the user to avoid asking as many questions as possible.

## Incentives and integration

Both examples show the challenge. Individual Trusts can control their local system, but national services have to work across complex systems.

The obesity service works because it aligns incentives for all parties – ICBs get their statutory solution, hospitals get capacity relief, patients get choice. At national level, without the data we need to personalise interactions, we’re asking people intrusive questions.

I’m going to map our current portfolio against this. Which services can deliver value as digital alone? Which ones need integration with in‑person? For the services that need integration – what do local organisations need to make partnership worthwhile?

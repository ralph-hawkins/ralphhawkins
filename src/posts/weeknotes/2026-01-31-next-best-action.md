The first priority for Manage my Health is to find something we can ship relatively quickly – test our approach, learn by doing, add value. We’re looking for something a cross-cutting team can do, ideally connecting between services.

We spoke to product leads across Digital Prevention Services this week about their work and working with the NHS app.

The app sits at the apex of all the things that are difficult about working in the NHS. It’s on top of a patchwork of technology, data, organisations. Finding the right people is messy. Creating joined‑up experiences is difficult because the basic building blocks you’d hope exist – like standardised ways of classifying appointments – don’t. The plumbing is fucked.

Because everything is so hard, even things you’d think should obviously exist – like a list of screenings you’ve attended – need to prove their value. [Dan Bower](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielbower/) questioned whether the app adds value for some journeys. If we send someone a link and it works, why add the friction of logging in first? It’s a good challenge.

But the app has an outsized influence, in one good way at least. It’s a point of coalescence for the NHS. Something that the rest of the organisation can see as useful – a way into their services. Our job is to find a way of doing that which works for users.

In the spirit of working openly, here are some high‑level ideas we’ve been discussing. Very early days, not yet agreed, not exhaustive. Not filtered by how achievable they might be.

### Personalised health risk summary
Make abstract risk more tangible. Example: persistently showing your heart age after completing an NHS Health Check.

### User‑submitted data
Improve personalisation and control. Example: recording a vaccine you had privately or abroad, so you don’t get prompted for something you’ve already done.

### Local NHS can enable home monitoring
Give users easier access to monitoring that connects with their care. Example: an ICB selects a cohort who need to record blood pressure, using the app to track it.

### Next best action
Guide users through the complexity. Example: after an NHS Health Check identifies lung cancer screening eligibility, suggest completing the pre‑screening questionnaire.

### Book a prevention specialist
Help users get consultation on what they could be doing. Example: pilot using WhatsApp or any messaging platform with a small cohort.

### Prevention overview
Clearer expectations of what’s upcoming and access to records. Example: a summary screen showing vaccination, screening, and health checks.

### Better messages
Use what digital communication is good at. Example: prompt someone to complete an NHS Health Check after a vaccination – catching them while they’re engaged.

### Health goals
Support sustained behaviour change. Example: set one goal, receive a monthly check‑in asking how it’s going.

Looking at that list, I worry there’s nothing in the sweet spot – shippable within weeks or a few months and adds real value. We spent time last week defining criteria for choosing what to work on. I think we can simplify this to – find something that looks remotely achievable.

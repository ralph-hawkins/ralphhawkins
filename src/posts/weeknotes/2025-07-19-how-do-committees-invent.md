The highlight this week was spending time with the Intelligent Navigation team and sharing what we’re each working on. Intelligent Navigation is one of the NHS app teams. They’re helping route people through the complexity of primary care (GPs, pharmacies, dentists), urgent care (walk-in centres, NHS 111) and emergency care (A&E).

Their principles are essentially the same as ours. How do you use what you know about a person to make navigating the complexity of the NHS more efficient and direct people to where they need to be?

Their approach is to use Adjusted Clinical Groups (ACGs) to inform decisions around what treatment a person needs. ACGs categorise patients by how complex their health needs are. Someone healthy with a fever gets different advice than someone with multiple long‑term health conditions and the same fever.

There are some differences between helping route people when they’re suffering from something that needs immediate treatment and helping people look after their health before they become sick. In prevention we want to give people choice in what support they need. We’ve seen many people would prefer to get mental health support before trying something like stopping smoking or becoming more active. There’s also research to show that behaviour change needs to start with trust. I don’t think that would be entirely absent from getting immediate treatment, but perhaps other needs are likely to take higher priority.

The overall pattern is the same though. Use what data you have about the person and the available next step to triage them better. There are some clear ways each of our services will benefit each other. Using ACGs will help us make sure we recommend something safe for a user. For example, we wouldn’t recommend anyone with an eating disorder started trying to lose weight using an unsupervised programme. The data we use to help understand a user’s health risk will also feed into the ACG to improve its accuracy.

I think there’s our work needs to unify. These are journeys that, if you look at them with enough abstraction, are very similar. We’re still early in the work we’re doing in prevention and have a lot to learn. We’ve deliberately moved away from an abstracted platform approach to more specific condition‑led services. But eventually we want to get to the place where we can deal with a person’s health needs in a way that doesn’t silo them by a specific condition, but meets all their needs.

Beyond treating prevention holistically, users shouldn’t have to be aware of the difference between ‘prevention’ and ‘treatment‘ services. They just need to feel better. Ideally user journeys within the NHS would seamlessly hand‑off between people who are in a prevention part of the journey and people who need immediate care. There is already work in our teams to recognise when someone is at immediate risk, but right now, that hand‑off is pretty basic.

Breaking down these silos is ultimately where we need to get to. That’s hard in the NHS – different funding, different governance, different metrics. I want to figure out how to do that well.

There are opportunities to drive alignment. I think adopting the same ACG model gives us a shortcut to interoperability and will help add value sooner. Longer term I think we need a shared framework to help users determine their best next action, whether that’s visiting A&E or quitting smoking.

This week I’ve been worrying about how much time I spend thinking about alignment, helping shape a discovery into health assessments and getting closer to the Personalised Prevention Platform team.

### Alignment

If you were designing a system that was prone to duplication, it would look like public health in England. As far as I understand it, we have at least five policy organisations and more than 1,000 organisations responsible for delivery.

Everyone within NHS England is railing against waste. There are maps, slide decks, catalogues and many meetings aimed to get alignment. For example, we recently spent three hours in a workshop mapping all the prevention initiatives across different teams.

The benefits of alignment are clear.

But avoiding duplication has a cost.

Taken to the extreme, it’s risk-averse and biases against action. I can’t help wondering – if we spent the time building stuff instead of trying to align, would we be doing a better or worse job?

I’m aiming for us to be pragmatic with a sprinkling of denial. Speak to people while we push on with delivery. Accept the risk.

Hope that if we’re ahead of other people they’ll have to align to us. Map only what’s relevant. Align with people as we learn about new things.

### Health assessment discovery

When [Irina Pencheva](https://www.linkedin.com/in/irina-pencheva-2b431825/) and I first wrote the discovery scope for our exploration into health assessments, it had two aims:

1. Establish the impact of making more health assessments digital (we already have the NHS health check online)
2. Investigate if we can do this through health assessment components (for example, if two or more assessments need a blood pressure check, can it be the same code, design, protocols etc.)

#### Risk calculation

Before the discovery kick-off, Irina and I spent time thinking about gaps in what was happening against what needed to happen to meet our vision for personalised prevention.

The biggest gap was risk calculation.

Our vision for personalised prevention assumes that we can help users to check their health, understand their risks and help them find services that reduce their risks. We are working on helping people check their health and find services, but what are we doing to help people understand their risks?

#### All the scopes

Irina (ruthless pragmatist and always one step ahead of me) was confident that calculating risk could be included in the health assessment discovery.

I wasn’t sure if three aims was not two too many aims for a discovery. But the aims are closely related and we have smart people working on the discovery, so we added the third aim.

In the kick-off for the discovery, I tried to emphasise my concerns about the breadth of aims. Nobody seemed in the least worried.

Two weeks in, the discovery team is getting into the weeds of the problem space.

I’m having interesting conversations with [Anisha Kanabar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anishakanabar/) – service designer on the team, about what health assessments are (do they include screening?) and whether risk calculation is a component of a health assessment or stands alone. Can you have an assessment without a risk calculation? Can you have a risk calculation without an assessment?

So far, my loosely held conclusion is that the risk calculation needs to be agnostic of the health assessment so it can calculate someone’s risk regardless of where the data comes from.

Including risk calculations in discovery was right, but I’m curious about what the team will recommend we do next.

### Working with Personalised Prevention Platform

The things in my area could be better named. I’m often explaining the relationship between Personalised Prevention Services (PPS) and Personalised Prevention Platform (PPP).

PPS is our wider team, which includes NHS Health Check Online, the health assessment discovery and PPP.

PPP is looking at helping people find the best next step for improving their health.

I think if we tried to name the team better, it might constrain them. Maybe a confusing team name is good actually. The team have more important things to spend time on.

The PPP team have just started an alpha phase and I’m filling the service designer gap in the team.

I had a chat with Simon Wilson – the Personalised Prevention Platform Product Manager (PPPPM) this week about how busy I was and what support I could give to the team. I found myself saying ‘nobody is asking me to do the work I’m doing’. Which is sort of true and also not at all.

I joined them as a team member on Wednesday and then didn’t have the capacity to participate in much of the time they set aside to work as a team. We’ll see how it goes, but I already feel like I’m letting the team down.

The time I have spent with the team has been valuable. Getting into the detail of the problems is reassuring and is helping me to refine our strategy.

### Next week

I’m going to:

- prioritise time with PPP
- attend ‘big room planning’ which aims to help teams across ‘Products and Platforms’ (the parent of the bit I work in – Digital Prevention Services), align
- plan the session Sarah Fisher and I are running for [Services Week](https://services.blog.gov.uk/2025/01/30/get-involved-with-services-week-2025/)
